TED
Command

Tom Kihlken 
1988 No. 19 (Utilities)


Purpose:	A small, full-screen editor for line-oriented files of up to 
64K in length that supports scrolling, cut, copy, paste, and printing
operations, and permits entry of all members of the IBM character set.
	
Format:	TED [filespec]
	
Remarks:	TED will open and read a file whose name (and path, if required)
are supplied initially.  If no filespec is provided it will open a new file and
prompt for a filename when the Save and Exit command (F7) is given.  The
original of a modified file is saved with a .BAK extension.  The Abort command
(F1), when verified, abandons any modifications and leaves the original file
intact.

	Lines may be of any length, and each must be terminated by pressing
Enter.  Lines longer than the screen width display a diamond in the rightmost
column.  Offscreen characters (up to 248 columns) may be viewed by using the
Ctrl-<arrow> keys.  Lines may be broken by pressing Enter at any point, and may
be conflated by pressing Delete at the line end.

F1 -- (Abort) exit with out saving.
F2 -- (Cut) removes blocked text to the paste buffer.
F3 -- (Print) Pressing F3 prints the blocked text. 
F4 -- (Mark) A block of text is defined by toggling on the Mark command (F4)
      and moving the cursor with the arrow keys.  The Marked area is shown in
      inverse video.
F5 -- (Copy) copies blocked text to the paste buffer.
F6 -- (Paste) inserts text from the paste buffer at any point where the 
      cursor is located.  The paste buffer remains intact until another 
      section is cut or copied.
F7 -- (Exit) Save and Exit
F8 -- (Find) Finds a String of characters.
F9 -- (Del l) deletes the entire line. 
F10 - (Udel l) restores the most recent deletion of F9.  

Ctrl F1 -- (Open) Opens a new file.
Ctrl F2 -- (New) Cuts away all text from the file buffer. Other buffers
	   remain unchanged
Ctrl F5 -- (Copy2d) copies blocked text to a disk file.
Ctrl F6 -- (Merge) inserts text from a disk file.
Ctrl F7 -- (Save) saves with out exiting.
Ctrl F8 -- (Find_r) finds another occurance of the same string.


	The Home and End keys move the cursor to the beginning and end of the
current screen line; the Tab key moves to the next column evenly divisible by
eight.  Text is entered in Insert mode by default; pressing the Insert key
toggles to overstrike mode.  TED configures itself to the display in use and
supports EGA and VGA text mode 3, the standard 80 columns by 25 rows.
PgUp and PgDn scroll the file by the number of rows displayed, minus 5.  
Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn move to the top and bottom of the file.  

	Any character in the IBM set can be entered by pressing the Alt key,
typing its ASCII value on the numeric keypad, then releasing the Alt key. 



I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE CHANGES I MADE TO THE "TED" SOURCE CODE.
I ADD A FEW THINGS TO MAKE MY PROGAMMING EASIER, AND I AM
PASSING THE SOURCE CODE ON TO YOU SO YOU CAN DO THE SAME.
