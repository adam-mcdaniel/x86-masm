  |  This program is released to the public domain by the author on         |
  |  February 15, 1989 at the Software Development Conference,              |
  |  San Francisco, CA.  With the understanding that there are no           |
  |  warranties of any sort either expressed or implied, you may use the    |
  |  code in whole or part for any lawful purpose.  The author does not     |
  |  warrant or guarantee that this code is fit for any particular purpose. |
  |  You are under no obligation to acknowledge the author when using this  |
  |  code, but you may do so if you desire.  The author neither seeks nor   |
  |  desires any contributions for this code.                               |

  |  Should you desire to communicate with the author, the preferred method |
  |  is via the author's bulletin board, Pontchippi.  Pontchippi is an      |
  |  OPUS board.  You may contact it directly at 504-244-1417 or via net    |
  |  mail to node 390/105.  The board has a 9600 baud US Robotics Courier   |
  |  HST modem.  Should you contact the board directly, access to the board |
  |  is granted immediately up completion of a very simple questionnaire.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  The author wishes to acknowledge and thank Jack Purdum and Tim Leslie  |
  |  of Ecosoft for their assistance and support.  In addition to Jack and  |
  |  Tim, Steve Russell of SLR Systems was also of invaluable assistance.   |
  |  All helped in this project by debugging and offering their expert      |
  |  advice and guidance.  They always had time for me seemingly whenever   |
  |  I requested it.                                                        |

  |  Finally, this program is dedicated to the memory of my father-in-law,  |
  |  Mariano "Val" Valentino.  The only request the author makes for        |
  |  using the program is that the program name be left as "VAL" in his     |
  |  memory.                                                                |

Toad Hall Notes:

VAL.EXE is an undocumented linker.  Since the authors didn't send any
documentation, we'll have to figure it out ourselves.  I've done a little,
and hopefully others will contribute to the fund of knowledge.  Email me
whatever you learn and I'll continue to update VAL.DOC.


From V.BAT:
	asm  ted1 ted1 nul nul
	val /co ted1, , , ,

If you enter no command line at all (or missing parameters),
VAL queries you for

	OBJ file(s):
	EXE file[d:\name.exe]:
	LST file:
	LIB file(s):

So you can designate the file names for output, *and* the names of any
(assumably MASM-compatible) .LIBs you wish to use.  It looks like the
command line syntax would be:

val /co ted1, , , ,

Syntax: VAL objfiles, exefile, mapfile, libfiles, ???file

Command line switches:

From what I've been able to figure out via experimentation:

	/co		produces .COM executable
	/map		produces .MAP file


A dump of text within VAL.EXE revealed interesting words (possible
commandline switches or parameters) :

	alignexeheader
	buffersize
	caseignore
	comfile
	cparmaxalloc
	detaillevel
	dosseg
	exechecksum
	grouphashsize
	lnamehashsize
	maxexternals
	maxgroups
	maxlnames
	maxsegments

which just might correlate with these error messages:

 Error:  Too many externals.  Max of %u exceeded.
         Retry with larger "/maxexternals:n" switch.

 Error:  Too many GRPDEFs.  Max of %u exceeded.
         Retry with larger "/maxgroups:n" switch.
 Error:  Too many LNAMES.  Max of %u exceeded.
         Retry with larger "/maxlnames:n" switch.

 Error:  Too many SEGDEFs.  Max of %u exceeded.
         Retry with larger "/maxsegments:n" switch.

Try running again with smaller buffersize and/or
virtualized fixup processing.


[Some other possible switches:]

	noalignexeheader
	nocaseignore
	nocomfile
	nodosseg
	noexechecksum
	nomap
	noobjchecksum
	nopackcode
	nopause
	nosysfile
	nostatistics
	order
	publichashsize
	segmenthashsize
